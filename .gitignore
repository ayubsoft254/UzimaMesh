# pyenv
#   For a library or binary, you wish to ignore these files
#   For a final application, you probably should check these files in
#   .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to check Pipfile.lock into source control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having cross-platform versions, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or even
#   refuse to install, on other platforms.
#   In that case, you might wish to ignore Pipfile.lock.
#   .pipenv
#   Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to check poetry.lock in for applications.
#   But if you decide to ignore it, uncomment the line below:
#   poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to check pdm.lock in for applications.
#   But if you decide to ignore it, uncomment the line below:
#   pdm.lock

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/pdm-project/pdm
